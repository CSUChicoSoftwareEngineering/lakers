Purpose:
“Grade-book” is a Desktop Application that will perform all the mathematical calculations needed to find out the standard deviation, average, and minimum scores for a classroom. It will have more features available such as displaying statistical information on a per student basis and display data on graphs. The backbone data will be stored in an SQL Database. This Desktop Application will be driven by a simple, easy to use, and intuitive UserInterface. 

Meet the Team:

Alejandro Velazquez - I am double majoring in Computer and Electrical Engineering. I transferred to Chico State in the Fall of 2013 with associate degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science. I am excited to work in a team environment to pursue the same end goal and develop a piece of Software from the ground up.
